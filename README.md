# swedishgym_web
Web dashboard designed to manage the "Gym Suedoise" (Swedish Gym) timetable.

This web app has been developped in a month, and was part of a multi-platform engineering school project during May 2016.

Due to most data being private, the API linked to this app hasn't been released, thus all requests to JOHANET.FR won't work. The rest API has been created using Silex.

Features include :
- classrooms visualization on a MapBox/leaflet map
- classes visualization on a custom made, spare timetable
- classes and classrooms visualization on several Chart.JS charts.
- directories for hosts and teachers with contact info for each of them
- All the views are connected in the way that they share the same data and share the same filters.
